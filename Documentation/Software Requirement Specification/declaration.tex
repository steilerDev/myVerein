\section*{Preliminary note}

\vspace*{2em}
Abbreviations or technical terms are not specially marked, but can be found in the list of abbreviations respectively in the glossary. While characterizing or enumerating persons I will relinquish the feminine and just use the masculine form. This is because of simplification and should not be seen as any kind of discrimination.
