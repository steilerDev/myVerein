\chapter{Product environment}
\section{Application area}
The system is combining a messaging app, as well as event organisation and news publishing service. These functionalities are intended to be used in the context of a single club or organisation.

\section{User group}
The application can be used by every registered member of an organisation, owning a smartphone with internet connection. Concluding the application is going to be used by a wide age group, including people that are not very familiar with the technology they are operating.

The setup and administration of the server environment should be done by a person that is a skilled IT administrator.

\section{Operation condition}
The application is intended to run on a iPhone 6 in upright orientation, operated by one user at a time. The server application needs to run on a web server with any operating system.

\chapter{Technical requirements}
\section{Software}
The users device needs to run at least iOS 8. The server is recommended to run a current version of Linux, for example Debian Whezzy or Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

\section{Hardware}
To use the application the user needs an iPhone or iPad of an independent revision. The server needs to be scaled according to the amount of registered members and requests.

\paragraph{Efficiently:}

It is important to establish an efficient workflow to ensure a frustration free operation. 

\paragraph{Functionality:}

It is important, that the application is meeting all obligatory and optional requirements.

\paragraph{Portability:}

The app should primary run on Apple smartphones and the porting to an Apple tablet or Android device is optional.

\paragraph{Adjustability:}

A user friendly interface is not very important since the system application should only be operated by skilled administrators.

\paragraph{Efficiently:}

It is important to establish an efficient workflow to ensure a frustration free operation. 

\paragraph{Functionality:}

It is important, that the application is meeting all obligatory and optional requirements.

\paragraph{Portability:}

The application needs to support a wide array of operating systems and thereby it is very important to have a high portability.

\paragraph{Adjustability:}

The core of the application is not intended to be massively altered after the initial implementation.

\chapter{Non-functional requirements}

Since the Software uses sensible user information, it has to fulfil the requirements of the corresponding laws in the country where it should be used. In this special case, it has to fulfil the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz. Therefore it is not allowed to store any data, which is not directly needed for the system. If there are additional Information stored, the user has to be informed and needs to agree to that usage.

The system should consume as less CPU Power as possible, to make the complete server as efficient as possible, while still ensuring a reliable operation. This can be achieved by efficient programming and a good initial design.

The complete source code and the documentation is going to be licensed using a GNU GPL version 2 license. If the content is not applicable to the GNU GPL version 2 license a Creative Commons - Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike - 4.0 International License will be used.

\chapter{User interface}

For the user interface a common color scheme needs to be evaluated. This scheme would help the user to associate a logo, web page or user interface to an application or brand.

\section{User application}
The application should have a tabbed layout (Like the Facebook app). This view would have up to 5 entries: Calendar, Chats, Photos, News, Settings.

\section{Server application}

The responsive Twitter bootstrap engine would be used to design the user interface for the web application administrating the server application.

\chapter{Development environment}

\section{Software}

For the development of the iPhone application the xCode IDE is going to be used, while the Java based server application is developed using Netbeans IDE.

\section{Hardware}

The software is going to be developed on a MacBook Pro Mid 2010, 15". The client application is tested on an iPhone 6, while the server application is going to be tested on a root server provided by the university running a common Linux distribution.
