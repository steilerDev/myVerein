\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:Intro}

Especially in rural areas, today's world of clubs is dominated by small and medium size organisations. Based on my personal experience, these clubs are mostly managed using outdated techniques and their communication channels are mostly handled through existing social networks, electronic or non-electronic mail. This is due to the fact that most of the members and management boards of the societies are either not familiar enough with the complexity of the few modern club management solutions, do not know of their existence or can't see the implications of using them.

\emph{myVerein} is trying to solve these problems and provides a comprehensive and intuitive solution for small and medium size clubs. Using the benefits of the recent developments of the IT industry and the principles of cloud and mobility solutions it can be the management solution of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century. 

In the following chapters, first the analysis of the existing market and the targeted user group is discussed. Afterwards the initial concept is defined, followed by the process of planning and designing. In the end I will go into the final implementation and present the current state of the application, followed by a retrospection on the whole project as well as an outlook into the future work of the system.

\section{Market analysis}
\label{sec:MarketAnalysis}

A common principle in todays business is analysing all comparable products and solutions, that are used by potential customers. These solutions might not even be designed for that purpose, but are misused by the user, because there is no real alternative available.

The most important part is the identification of the mistakes the competitors make and learn from their semantic errors \cite{Hunter:2015aa}. With these findings it is possible and important as well, to draw parallels and use them to \enquote{model what is working for your competition and [...] not copy your competition directly} \cite{Hunter:2015aa}. 

There are several ways to identify competitors and keep an eye on their software solutions: Talsk to potential customers to better get a closer look at their current needs as well as to study their present working environment, use web research to find more brilliant answers to the requirements and needs of the clubs \cite{Philips:2015aa}. Take benefit of search engines to study the presentation and marketing concepts of identified competitors \cite{Philips:2015aa}. Last but not least you can gather additional information within social media platforms, at trade shows or on various email newsletter \cite{Dahl:2011aa}. 

Within this section the competing services that have been found and analysed in preparation of this work are going to be presented. Here I'd like to thank all administrators with the \emph{Freiwillige Feuerwehr Lohr} and \emph{Melomania Helmstadt} for their remarkable support and feedback they gave my to analyse market needs. With their help I could identify just one substantial provider named \emph{Buhl Data Service}. Nevertheless most of all clubs use combinations of various services and applications since there are hardly comprehensive and affordable remedies for them to find. The resulting concept and its implementation, which are strongly based on these findings, can be found in the upcoming chapters.

\subsection{Buhl Data Service}

The \emph{Buhl Data Service} company offers several solutions for the private and small to medium size business sector. Among them are applications used for the creation of tax statements and private banking. All solutions are tailored to the German market, since they cover country specific topics \cite{Buhl:2015aa}. Besides the above mentioned products \emph{Buhl Data Service} is also offering an application called \enquote{WISO Mein Verein}, whose purpose is the managing of members of a society as well as several other related tasks.

\emph{WISO Mein Verein} was initially designed to only be used by a single user at once. Later the developer introduced a team edition, which offered the ability to upload the database backing the application to a centralised repository, but while the data was modified, it is still not possible for a second user to access the data. In general this process of lock - modify - unlock is very unintuitive and lacks of transparency. This process therefore reduces the usability dramatically, especially for administration without a technical background.

The functionalities provided by the application are widely ranged from simply listing all members, to the creation of automated debit transfers as well as storing and populating templates for non-electronic newsletter. The suite itself looks like a very mature product, only its graphical user interface and missing cross platform functionalities are not completely meeting today's standards \cite{Buhl:2015ab}. 

During this project the company launched the public beta of a newly created online social network, targeting member and administrators of clubs. The service is integrated into the \emph{WISO Mein Verein} environment and called \emph{Mein Verein}. An administrator has the possibility to import the data from his \emph{WISO Mein Verein} suite and invite all users to use the social network. 

The network is accessible through a web portal and an Android and iOS app. The portal is said to cover all expected functionalities of a modern social network targeted at members of clubs, including messaging, calendar functions and the ability to search, join and create societies. 

Unfortunately the deadline for my research project did not permit an extensive testing of this portal but still raises questions with me: How well the managing of the club is integrated in the web portal. Specifically speaking if all functionalities known from \emph{WISO Mein Verein} are available through \emph{Mein Verein} or if the administration needs to maintain two separated data sets, that might become inconsistent. 

Both solutions do not share a common pricing scheme. \emph{WISO Mein Verein} is charged separately yearly, starting at 69,99 Euro for the single user version and 139,95 Euro for the team version \cite{Buhl:2015ab}. On the other hand the usage of the web portal \emph{Mein Verein} is completely free of charge and advertisement free. This leads to the question how \emph{Buhl Data Service} is planing monetising that product. Since the portal is handling private user data and is also holding private bank details, in case it is connected to the \emph{WISO Mein Verein} suite, it is crucial that these data are not shared with a third party.

\subsection{Incomprehensive solution}

A comprehensive solution covering both, managing a club as well as creating a unified communication channel is poorly realised through the \emph{Mein Verein} portal. On top of that the network just recently left its beta state and is a rather young and unknown application. Concluding most of the users as well as administrators still go their own way of handling their club business so they haven't got any reasonable alternatives.

While talking to several club members of different societies as well as from my own experience a couple of existing social networks and messaging applications are misused to connect the user and informing them about news concerning their club. 

One very popular option is the usage of hidden \emph{Facebook} groups, creating a broadcasting channel for administrators as well as user. Depending on the size of these groups, the personal notification system of the user's \emph{Facebook} will be flooded by unrelated and therefore uninteresting information. On top of that many user do not provide their actual personal information or aren't part of the network because of privacy reasons and therefore the user register created by these groups is incomplete, especially if the administrator is trying to communicate using traditional channels as well. 

Another famous way to communicate are instant messaging services like \emph{WhatsApp} where group messaging features are provided. Unfortunately every user receives a notification for each message send through the group. If, for example, there is a vivid discussion a user is not part of, the amount of received notification gets annoying. This system also does not provide any user or event management at all. So this needs to be done either through a separate channel, or the users need to manually maintain their calendar.

In total all these products have a unique use-case, but do not offer any comprehensive solution to the problem of managing a club and unifying its communication. Nevertheless there is a reason that these products are popular among users. Therefore the positive aspects should be closely examined and adopted, while resolving the shown problems.

\section{User analysis}
\label{sec:UserAnalysis}

During the creation of a product and especially during the creation of an user interface it is crucial to meet the requirements of the user and to never loose sight of them. A user is not going to spend much time on searching functionalities, which means he might be less satisfied with the product and consequentially use it less frequent, even though it implements all necessary requirements \cite{Frank:2013aa}. Therefore every functionality needs to be arranged logically and specifically tailored to the target audience.

This process is called usability engineering and focuses on guiding through the necessary steps resulting into a satisfying user experience \cite{Nielsen:1993aa}. The most important part is \enquote{the process of identifying usersâ€™ needs to ensure a product can achieve specific goals effectively and efficiently, which results in overall satisfaction and success} \cite{Frank:2013aa}.

The importance of usability engineering can also be seen in the fact, that the \gls{ISO} is covering this topic as part of the ISO 9241 standard. The author is referring to section 210 of the standard, which is labelled \enquote{Human-centred design for interactive systems}.It describes the general development cycle of an user interface, where the user analysis itself plays an important role \cite[p. 13]{Gulzow:2015aa}.

The usability engineering describes 2 major kinds of methods to analyse an user: analytical and empiric \cite[p. 20]{Gulzow:2015aa}. Within an analytical approach the developer is trying to see things from a user's perspective, where empiric methods involve the user directly. 

For this project the \emph{Persona} method was used to perform a user analysis. Personae are several relevant users, described by their archetypal properties. Additionally their behaviour and objectives are presented \cite[p. 30]{Gulzow:2015aa}. This method is useful since the developer gets a better picture of the people using his application later and can therefor focus on their needs. Within this sections three key personae are presented, which are used in section \vref{sec:Requirements} to identify the requirements on the system. These presented findings are mainly based on personal experience, as well as information received by different club administrators. The personae are ordered from the most to the least relevant one.

\paragraph{Jacob - 41}
\label{sec:Jacob}

Jacob is father of two and lives in a small house with his family in the outskirts of a small German town. Besides his work at a global oriented medium sized technology company, he is a volunteering member at the local sports club. Generally speaking he is technology affine, but not an expert. His honorary post is managing all members of the club. This includes the listing of all active and passive members, as well as ensuring that everyone paid their membership fees. Additionally he has the responsibility to invite all members to events organised by the club. 

The utilities Jacob is using to do his job at the club include an Excel sheet with all names and contact details, as well as a Word template for his invitations for several events. Recently he created an email distribution list to save the money he always spend on mailing the paper letters. Besides a handful older members everyone is receiving these emails. Nevertheless the constantly changing club structure and contact details are hard to manage and he spends a lot of time updating his member list.

\paragraph{Marie - 21}
Marie is a student and recently moved out of her parent's house. She is an active soccer player since nearly 10 years at the sport club. Unfortunately she often misses special events organised by her club, because in the past she barely paid attention to the club mail, handled by her parents. Since she receives emails from her club on her smartphone she regularly updates her calendar according to the events, but slowly gets annoyed by the amount of data she has to organise besides her studies.

On top of that she is part of a \emph{WhatsApp} group dedicated to her team where all kinds of topics are discussed, ranging from the last party to the next game. Over and above a soccer group dedicated to her club was created on \emph{Facebook}, where additional information are shared.

Since she just shortly changed her address she is tying to get her new contact details registered at the club. Unfortunately after asking her coach and the head of the club to change the information she is currently waiting for a conformation from Jacob about the successful change. All in all she is not very satisfied with the current infrastructure and possibilities offered by the club.

\paragraph{Karl - 58}
Karl is a farther of 2 and grandfather of 5. He had lived together with his wife in the same house for nearly 30 years. Even longer he has been a part of the local sports club. Because of his age he is not as active as he used to be, but he helps everywhere he can. The electrician plays an important part in maintaining the club house and supporting teams during their game days.

Even though he owns a PC, which was a present from his children, he is not very confident using it. Therefore he does not receive any information through email, but through traditional non-electronic mail, as well as through personal contact with the responsible parties.  

\section{Unique selling point}
\label{sec:SellingPoint}

The result of the market and user analysis above lead to the conclusion that there is the a real need for a comprehensive solution. Considering all facts and findings discussed in this chapter, the key points of the application can now be derived. 

The first and most important point of the application is to reduce the workload on the person managing the members of the club as well as advertising events, described as Jacob in section \vref{sec:Jacob}. Since this person is already spending at lot of his time on keeping the club running, mostly free of any charge, he should perform his work as efficient as possible. This should also include the possibility to delegate work to other people, e.g. every user could be responsible to keep his contact information up-to-date, without the need of the administrator being actively involved.

The second point of the application is reducing the personal organisation overhead for a single user. Specifically talking a user should be automatically reminded of upcoming events and he have an easy way of checking a personalised, up to date schedule of his club related events.

Finally the group pressure on individuals to join one or multiple social networks or applications must get stopped by providing a safe and trustfully environment. People not able to do or not feeling confident with using latest technology should not get forced into using it. In contrast a viable alternative have to be offered to these users. 

These three points basically cover the main idea behind this project. Of course, more items out of the findings in this chapter can get taken into concern but it would push the boudaries of this project to deeply discuss them. Nevertheless they are briefly discussed in chapter \vref{chapter:OngoingWork}.

\chapter{Concept}
\label{chapter:Concept}
Within this chapter the initial thoughts, leading to the concept of the application, are described, respecting the findings from chapter \ref{chapter:Intro}. This chapter will present different approaches that could have been chosen to solve the problem. An evaluation of these possibilities, based on feasibility, necessity and user value is going to be provided in chapter \vref{chapter:Design} and \vref{chapter:Implementation}.

\section{Platform} % Mapping to deployment model/ER model/architectural overview
\label{sec:Platform}
Nowadays a solution can be created focusing on a wide area of devices and using several technologies supported by these platforms. In general, the workload increases with each platform and/or technology that is included into the development process. Concluding a well balanced trade-off, based on the available time, needs to be made when choosing the platform and technology for a project.

The most conservative approach is developing a stand-alone desktop application. The interaction using mouse and keyboard is the most established one and possibly the only point of contact with modern \gls{IT} systems for non-technology oriented people. Nevertheless this platform and technology is concluding several negative aspects: A single \gls{OS} needs to be chosen and every additional one would include a massive amount of supplementary work, based on the assumption of not using cross platform technologies, like \emph{\Acrfull{WOCA}} or \emph{\Acrfull{WORA}}. On top of that time spend online on mobile devices recently surpassed desktop application \cite{Murtagh:2014aa}, which reduces the importance of them.

	\label{fig:Shares}
\end{figure}
\nocite{IDC:2015aa, IDC:2015ab}

As shown in the last paragraph the importance of mobile applications rose tremendously within the last couple of years. Therefore I believe it is essential to take this platform into consideration. When looking at the market shares of mobile \gls{OS}, shown in figure \vref{fig:OSMarketShare}, it seems obvious that an application should initially be developed for the \emph{Android} platform, since it holds a market share of 76.6\% \cite{IDC:2015aa}. Later the development for \emph{iOS} (19.7\%) and \emph{Windows Phone} (2.8\%) might be considered \cite{IDC:2015aa}. But when looking at vendor market shares, shown in figure \vref{fig:VendorMarketShare}, this picture is not so obvious anymore. \emph{Apple}, the only vendor distributing devices with the \emph{iOS} \gls{OS}, has nearly the same market share as \emph{Samsung}, the biggest vendor of \emph{Android} running mobile devices \cite{IDC:2015ab}.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}
  		\centering
  		\includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{./images/android-os.png}

	\caption{Mobile \gls{OS} fragmentation, retrieved from \cite{OpenSignal:2014aa}}
	\label{fig:MobileOSFragmentation}
\end{figure}
\nocite{OpenSignal:2014aa}

As you can see in figure \vref{fig:MobileOSFragmentation}, the \emph{Android} platform seems more fragmented than the \emph{iOS} eco-system. This is due to the fact that the \gls{OS} is distributed by several vendors, who create device with different specification. On top of that the support for the latest version of the \gls{OS} is never guaranteed. Finally this will not only leave devices open for security vulnerabilities, but also increases the workload for the developer. As shown in figure \vref{fig:iOSOSFragmentation}, nearly 99\% of the \emph{iOS} devices were running the two latest versions of the \gls{OS} in 2014. In opposite to that, figure \ref{fig:AndroidOSFragmentation} shows that not even 50\% of the \emph{Android} devices use the three latest revisions of the platform. This fragmentation is also reflected by figure \vref{fig:MobileScreenFragmentation}, which is showing all screen sizes of mobile devices running \emph{Android}, respectively \emph{iOS}, as of 2014. Obviously \emph{Android} has more distinct screen sizes and aspect ratios than \emph{iOS}, which makes it more difficult for the developer to create a suitable \gls{UI}.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\label{fig:MobileScreenFragmentation}
\end{figure}
\nocite{OpenSignal:2014aa}

Concluding, when creating an app for the \emph{Android} platform the developer is facing several design decisions, which either increase the complexity of the program or reduce its functionality or accessibility. In opposite to that a developer choosing the \emph{iOS} platform can easily create an application which is optimised for all available devices, as well as exploiting all recent features offered by the \gls{OS} without excluding users, who are not running on the latest version. 

Another decision that needs to be made is the amount of functionalities available on the different platforms. Eventually it is smarter to restrict certain functionalities to a platform or technology. This might decrease the complexity of a single application, but increase the development complexity, since the there are going to be more smaller applications.

In opposite of creating an application that includes all functionalities offered by the system there might be a dedicated application for administrative tasks and member related tasks. This would reduce the complexity of the respective app and hide uninteresting features from the regular user, while only creating a minor overhead for the small group of administrators. Since the tasks might be very different, even the adoption of a different platform or technology could be considered. 

\section{Architecture} % Mapping to deployment model/ER model/architectural overview
\label{sec:Architecture}
The architectural decision highly depends on the platform and technology chosen. When making this decision, it comes to choose between a multi-tier, also known as client-server, and a single-tier, also known as client-only, architecture.

In comparison to a multi-tier web application that is accessed by multiple users at the same time, the complexity of a single tier desktop application is is surely easier to manage though it comes along with several negative implications. The biggest impact for the administrator would be the missing possibility to delegate certain tasks to other members. On top of that locally stored information can not be accessed by any user, because of availability and security limitations of a personal computer.

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./images/tier-architecture.jpg}
  	\caption{2-tier and 3-tier architecture, retrieved from \cite{Wright:2015aa}}
	\label{fig:TierArchitecture}
\end{figure}
\nocite{Wright:2015aa}

In opposite to that, a multi-tier architecture enables the user to access and modify data through a centralised data provider. As shown in figure \vref{fig:TierArchitecture}, within a 2-tier architecture, the data is directly available, where a 3-tier architecture adds another abstraction or presentation layer between the raw data and the user. The decision, which kind of architecture to choose, highly depends on the application itself. 

The security of a 3-tier architecture might be more sophisticated, since the logic provided by a dynamic web server offers more possibilities to define user groups and access rights, but if the policy is not well designed, this might lead to violations. Therefore a 2-tier architecture might be a better pick, since it's configuration possibilities are more basic and therefore lead to less problems \cite{Wright:2015aa}.

Costs as well as maintainability is dependent on the complexity of the architecture. The 3-tier architecture is implicitly more complex and leads to higher costs and often poorer maintainability. On the other hand, a 3-tier application offers in most cases a better performance and its usability is more satisfying, since it provides a presentation layer \cite{Wright:2015aa}.

\section{Functionality} %Mapping to final use cases
\label{sec:Functionality}

A brief wrap up and explanation of the key functions was given in section \vref{sec:SellingPoint}. Based on these findings several distinct functionalities of the application can be derived. Due to the limited timeframe only a subset of the presented conclusions and ideas can get realised within this confined student research project.

\subsection{Administrator related functionalities}

Initially the administrator should be able to represent the organisational structure of his club within the application. In general a club is hierarchical organised, containing several divisions, with an arbitrary amount of subdivisions. This structure is highly dependent on the respective club and therefore needs to be as customisable as possible. 

As explained in chapter \vref{sec:SellingPoint} the administrator should have the ability to delegate the administration as easily as possible. Concluding it has to be technically feasible to assign a second level administrators to each division, splitting up the workload into easily manageable pieces. It is important to note that the second level administrators only have restricted access and modification rights. For example, they should only be able to view personal information of users they do directly administrate.

To manage the users of the club, the administrator needs to be able to create them. Each user should be associated with one or more divisions. On top of that several personal information need to be stored together with the user. These might include his address, banking information or club related information like his membership number or the dates he became active, passive or resigned from the club. This structure is dependent on the data, the club needs to operate and therefore the possibility should be given to add custom fields to the profiles of user. Upon the creation of a user, he might be informed about his new account through an automated email, where he is introduced to all features of the system and is invited to start using it.

Another time-consuming task of an administrator is the management and promotion of internal events. Those events should be created by any administrator, but a second-level administrator should only be able to invite users that are part of his managed divisions. Therefore the administrator cannot invite users to events that probably are not relevant to them. For administrative purposes it would be useful to receive feedback on the participation of certain events. To simplify the process, user should be invited on a division based selection, concluding the administrator does not need to pick each relevant member but only the relevant division.

The process of collecting membership fees is complicated and in-comprehensive, since some people use an automated debit transfer, some are transferring the money manually and others are paying cash. This process is hard to track and the application could simplify and centralise it by offering automated debit transfer from the member's bank account to the club and account monitoring. Therefore the application needs to interact with the club's bank account to authorise and supervise the membership fee transactions. The usage of this feature would need a high level of trust towards the application and its creator.

Besides the promotion of events, a club needs to inform the users regular about news concerning certain division or the club. Some of these information might get shared with the public in parallel which would resolve in an unnecessary overhead. Concluding, besides the implementation of a personalised news feed, the system could also offer the possibility to connect to webpage hosting frameworks, like Wordpress or Joomla and social media platforms, enabling the administrator to share information with the user's of the society as well as the public.

Additionally the application should also respect user that are not using the application, because of security concerns or their aversion towards modern technology. It is also possible that certain users do not own a system that is supported by the application. Concluding the software should support a fall back solution for these persons and offer information through standardised channels, like electronic or non-electronic mail.

Finally the application could aggregate interesting information for the administrator and present them within a dashboard. This might include upcoming events or statics about the usage of the platform. Last but not least the system could provide reminder about anniversaries or milestone birthdays of users, which would enable the club to reliable provide congratulations.

\subsection{User related functionalities}

As shown in chapter \vref{sec:SellingPoint} two of the three presented key functionalities are user oriented. Therefore the final application is probably going to have a fairly big amount of user related functionalities.

To get rid of different messaging technologies used within the club, a centralised group chat feature should be offered. These group chats should be created automatically for each division. User that are part of the respective division should have the ability to participate within this group chats. For the sake of simplicity, a group chat should only be available for divisions where this feature is useful, therefore the administrator should be able to select divisions where this feature is not available. To reduce the amount of notification received through a group chat, the user might only be reminded about an incoming message if he is explicitly mentioned.

The application should also support the user to manage his personalised club calendar and remind him about the beginning of upcoming events. The user should only be invited to events that apply to his respective position within the club. To support the planning of these events, the user should be able to respond to the invitation. Additionally a connection between the calendar system of the application and the native system of the respective operating system could be given, by using a standardised technology, like \emph{iCal}.

It is a difficult task for an club administrator to maintain the complete records of every user, especially if the user's contact detail change frequently. Therefore it would be a good way to delegate this task to the users. By enabling the user to update their profile on their own, the process is simplified for the administrator and the user. It also enables the user to give his appearance a personal touch, which might be discoverable by other users, if the permission was given.

The application could also provide a counterpart for the news published by administrators. This centralised newsfeed could provide user tailored information about relevant topics. The user could also decide about the amount and kind of notification he receives about these information. On top of that the he might be able to additionally subscribe to an email newsletter system or \gls{RSS} feed of the club.

Another problem a lot of clubs are facing is the problem of collecting useful and up to date information that can be used to promote the club or events on their webpage, in the newspaper or internally. The system could enable every user to hand in articles written about recent activities or to upload pictures and videos that are club related. These information should only be published if they are approved by an administrator, or handed in by a trusted user.

\section{User Interface} %% Mapping to wireframes

As discussed in chapter \vref{sec:UserAnalysis}, one of the most crucial parts of a system is the user interface, since this is the only part of the system the user is directly interacting with. A bad designed user interface can increase the complexity of an application, but also decrease user satisfaction.

The design concepts for an administrator focused web application and a user focused iOS application are presented in the following sections. In general the navigation concept is a crucial piece of these application. A very popular option to manage the navigation on webpages and mobile application is the so called \enquote{Hamburger Menu} \cite{Abreu:2014aa}. The three parallel horizontal lines indicating that there are more options available are widely used. Unfortunately there are several problems with this concept, including but not limited to lower discoverability, less efficiency, a clash with platform navigation concepts and the inability to get a glance view on the available options \cite{Abreu:2014aa}.

\subsection{Web application}
\label{sec:UIConceptWeb}

In general a web application has the possibility to display its information either horizontal or vertical. A combination through dropdown boxes is possible but should be avoided, because of the lower discoverability and less efficiency, already discussed above. \cite{Crestodina:2015aa}

On top of that it is important to put only a small amount of items in the navigation bar. This is based on the fact that the human short term memory in general is only able to hold an average of 7 items, and therefore the user would start forgetting items at the top of the list while scanning through the available navigation items. When limiting the amount to 5 items this would increase the importance of the remaining items, while increasing simplicity of the webpage itself. \cite{Crestodina:2015aa}. 

Psychology studies have shown that the most important items within a list are the first and last ones. Therefore a designer should consider the placement of important navigation items either at the beginning or end of the list. \cite{Crestodina:2015aa}

It is important to note that a user faster adopts well known structures and navigation concepts. Therefore using a non-standard navigation concept could decrease the usability even if it would solve problems of existing solutions, just because of the fact, that the user is not used to it. Especially when placing the navigation items in an unfamiliar place could lead to confusion. \cite{Crestodina:2015aa}

To increase usability, the user should always be aware of his current position within the application. On top of that the user should be given the possibility to change his current position at any time. This requires the need of always visible navigation elements. 

While all of this holds true in general the exceptions of these rules, are the concepts that a user is going to remember later. Although creating a new navigation concept, which is respecting only a subset of the above stated suggestions, or none of them, requires a lot of conceptional work. Besides that, the implementation of a non-standardised system also requires the need of starting from the scratch, which increases the workload drastically. \cite{Hampton-Smith:2013aa}

Besides the consideration of different navigation concepts the overall design of the different functionalities were also considered. However for the sake of simplicity only their mockups and final designs are presented in chapter \vref{sec:Wireframes}, respectively  \vref{sec:FrontEnd}. Especially since the formal definition of all functionalities, that are going to be implemented within this project, has not been given yet, this list would exceed the scope of this paper.

\subsection{iOS application}
\label{sec:UIConceptiOS}
\subsubsection{Navigation}
When creating an iOS application, a lot of design elements are pre-defined by the \gls{OS}. On the one hand this leads to well known design and navigation principles and following the guidelines will -in general- lead to a well designed application. On the other hand the applications are not very distinguishable based on their design and might become boring for the user. Concluding using an adjusted layout or navigation concept might lead to a better recognisability of the brand. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./images/ui-concept.jpg}
  	\caption{Early navigation concept drawing, own figure}
	\label{fig:NavConcept}
\end{figure}

Figure \vref{fig:NavConcept} shows early design concept drawings. On the left, a standard tab bar concept is presented. The bar contains a total of five elements, including \emph{Messages}, \emph{News}, \emph{Photos}, \emph{Events} and \emph{Settings}. This design is an example of a predefined layout provided by \emph{Apple}. It is important to note that there is no default design that uses the \enquote{Hamburger menu} described above. The tab bar is therefore a viable alternative, which would fit into the design-system of \emph{iOS} and consequentially might perish between the millions of other available application. Nevertheless very popular companies use this concept with minor adjustments, including \emph{Facebook}, \emph{Yelp} and \emph{Twitter}.

In opposite to that the left side of figure \vref{fig:NavConcept} describes a very different navigation concept. The author did not find this concept in any other application, although it was inspired by \emph{Todo Movie}'s sharing layout, as well as \emph{Google}'s material design. The main idea is the positioning of a fixed menu button in the lower part of the screen. When pressing this visual element, one of the two frames shown in the middle of figure \vref{fig:NavConcept}, would appear, revealing the menu. It might either be a \enquote{Navigation Wheel}, that could be operated using swipe gestures, or the available items could appear by moving up.

This concept has several advantages and disadvantages. By choosing a full screen presentation of the menu items, the amount of elements could be increased from a maximum of five, when using a tab bar, to about seven. This is the suggested maximum of navigation items, since the average person has a short term memory of seven elements \cite{Crestodina:2015aa}. On top of that, most of the user prefer well designed swipe gestures over taps, which might be adopted using the \enquote{Navigation wheel} menu. Since the menu button is a fixed item on top of most of the screens, this would attract the attention of the user and improve the engagement. On the opposite, this concept has similar downsides as the previously presented \emph{Hamburger menu}, which is, amongst others, missing the possibility to glance the available items \cite{Abreu:2014aa}.

\subsubsection{Chat overview}
\label{sec:ChatOverview}
For the sake of simplicity only the layout of the chat overview page is going to be discussed besides the navigation concept. Figure \vref{fig:ChatScreens} shows these screens of the two most established chat applications on the \emph{iPhone}, \emph{WhatsApp} and \emph{iMessage}. Obviously both concepts are very similar, since they both use a table view with slightly different cell layouts. This kind of concept is very useful, when there is the need of showing a big amount of items in an precise and easy to retrievable way. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{.33\textwidth}
  		\centering
  		\includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{./images/whatsapp-screen.jpg}
  		\caption{WhatsApp}
  		\label{fig:ChatWA}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}{.66\textwidth}
  		\centering
  		\includegraphics[width=0.98\linewidth]{./images/imessage-screen.jpg}
  		\caption{iMessage}
  		\label{fig:ChatiMessage}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Chat overview screenshots of established messaging apps retrieved from \cite{Inc.:2015aa} and \cite{Stuckler:2013aa}}
	\label{fig:ChatScreens}
\end{figure}
\nocite{Inc.:2015aa, Stuckler:2013aa}

Nevertheless the amount of available chats within \emph{myVerein} is very likely being limited to a foreseeable small quantity. Therefore, other concepts, besides the established list might be considered to increase the uniqueness and recognisability as well as usability. The proposed concept includes two circles per row with a caption, each representing an available chat. The chat with the latest message would be shown on the top left of the screen. Every chat bubble would have a caption stating the name of the division, whose chat it is representing. The image of the bubble would show the image representing the user, who sent the latest message. This might help the user to estimate the importance of the message. A \enquote{tap-and-hold} feature could also be included, showing a preview of the last couple of messages without entering the chat.

\subsection{Visual branding concept}
\label{sec:BrandingConcept}

To create a unique and recognisable brand it is important to have a visual branding scheme associated with it. For example, seeing a white tinted \enquote{F} in front of a blue background instantly leads to the \enquote{Facebook} brand. Therefore this section is devoted to the concept behind the creation of such a branding scheme. This includes the development of a colour scheme and an (app) icon.

\subsubsection{Colour scheme}
\label{sec:ColourConcept}

The field of colour theory is a very complex one, therefore the time only permitted a very basic analysis on this specific matter. The first thing to note is that different colours have different very distinct meanings. In general a slight change in saturation might lead to a completely new impression of a colour \cite{Chapman:2010aa}. For example the colour red is considered as a violent or aggressive colour, while green is more balancing, relaxing and down to earth \cite{Chapman:2010aa}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./images/colorwheel.jpg}
  	\caption{12-spoke colour wheel, retrieved from \cite{Chapman:2010ab}}
	\label{fig:ColourWheel}
\end{figure}

After choosing an appropriate base colour, it is important to create a colour palette, since a single colour would make the application boring, and the developer would be unable to highlight certain entries using a different tint. There are several techniques to create a colour pattern. When using a \emph{Monochromatic} colour scheme the base colour is only altered using different tones, shades and tints \cite{Chapman:2010ab}. 


Figure \vref{fig:ColourWheel} is showing a 12-spoke colour wheel, which is used when creating an \emph{Analogous} colour scheme. It is created by picking three colours that are next to each other and adjust their tones, shades and tints, just like the \emph{Monochromatic} colour scheme would do it \cite{Chapman:2010ab}. This scheme is creating a set of colours, that are very close to each other.

Since the \emph{Analogous} colour scheme is sometimes regarded as being boring, since the colours are very similar, the \emph{Complementary} scheme introduces a wider range, by selecting the colour opposite of the base within the colour wheel \cite{Chapman:2010ab}. This one is most likely being very different to the base colour and adds depth to the palette.

The most diverse colour scheme is called \emph{Tetradic} or \emph{Double-Complementary}. It is regarded as the most difficult scheme when trying to create an efficient palette \cite{Chapman:2010ab}. The scheme is \enquote{based on the tetrade â€” the foursome of colors evenly distributed on the fourths of the color wheel} \cite{Stanicek:2011aa}. Since this scheme is considered more nervous than the other ones \cite{Stanicek:2011aa}, the primary colour should be used for the main design, while the others are only sparely used for accents \cite{Chapman:2010ab}.

\subsubsection{App icon}
\label{sec:Icon}
Maybe one of the most important visual items of an application is its icon. It needs to be well designed, since the users are going to put it on his home screens or desktops and probably see it every day. On top of that it needs to be interesting enough to regularly click on it, but not too distractive. Lastly and most importantly the user needs to be able to look at the icon and directly associated it with the product. \cite{Flarup:2015aa}

Within this section we will only focus on the creation of an icon for the user facing \emph{iOS} app, since the web application does not necessarily need this icon, but might adopt it, to increase the visual connection between both of them.

As shortly covered above it is essential to keep some things in mind when working on a good icon. The first thing to note is scalability. When developing an application for \emph{iOS 8} a developer has to bundle 12 different resolution for the application icon and it has to look good in every one. Concluding \enquote{[o]verly complicated icons that try to cram too much onto the canvas often fall victim to bad scalability} \cite{Flarup:2015aa}, therefore the designer should embrace simplicity and check that the icon looks good on top of different background colours. \cite{Flarup:2015aa}

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./images/productivity-icons.png}
  	\caption{App-Icon design within the productivity category, retrieved from \cite{Flarup:2015aa}}
	\label{fig:AppProd}
\end{figure}
\nocite{Flarup:2015aa}

While keeping the icon scalable it is important to create a design that is recognisable. Therefore the app should not be overcomplicated. When trying to create such an icon it is useful to observe competitors in the same field as well as other popular app icon designs. \cite{Flarup:2015aa}

When looking at the competitor's app icons, it is important to note that a developer should not copy there design. Because uniqueness is another very important aspect of the icon layout, since it needs to attract the attention of the user, and should stand out of the competition. A negative example is the productivity category on the app store, shown in figure \vref{fig:AppProd}. Since all of the shown apps trying to solve a similar problem, they all end up having a more or less identical icon. When ending up, choosing a single glyph, like a checkmark, the designer needs to to make a difference by using a rich colour design. \cite{Flarup:2015aa}

Last but not least it is crucial to avoid text within an app icon. On the one hand, this text scales very badly, on the other hand the app is always accompanied with a caption, stating its name. Consequently a logo should not be used as an icon, since these two are very distinct \cite{Flarup:2015ab}. Nevertheless a single letter, used for example by the \emph{Facebook} app, might be a good way to create a distinguishable brand.

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./images/app-sketch.jpg}
  	\caption{Early application icon sketch, own figure}
	\label{fig:AppSketch}
\end{figure}

After considering all of the above stated concerns and doing some brainstorming, the best suitable association and unique association with a club, that was found, was an emblem. Figure \vref{fig:AppSketch} is showing an early sketched, created during this session. This very generic object is widely used as a foundation for many logos of different clubs. By leaving the banner empty, it leaves space for the user to imagine his club name or description into it. 

It was considered to form the emblem in a way to resemble to letter \enquote{V}. This could have let to an association with the application's name \emph{myVerein}, similar to the \emph{Facebook} logo. 

\chapter{Design}
\label{chapter:Design}

Using the initial thoughts and concept alternatives presented in chapter \vref{chapter:Concept} a design is going to be developed within this chapter. Based on this design the final implementation of the project is executed.

The author of this paper decided to implement the system using a three tier architecture (see section \vref{sec:Architecture}) using a user facing mobile iOS app and an administrator facing web application (see section \vref{sec:Platform}. The remaining details are discussed below.

\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:Requirements}
Within this section the most important requirements for the system are going to be presented. The complete formal list of all objectives can be found in the software requirement specification \cite{Steiler:2014aa} and the server requirement specification \cite{Steiler:2014ab}. The requirements are based on the options shown in chapter \vref{chapter:Design}. The decision, that were made are mainly justified, using the findings from chapter \vref{chapter:Intro}.

\subsection{Obligatory requirements} % must-have
\label{sec:ObligatoryReq}

This section states the obligatory requirements of the project. The functionalities described in this section are the most basic ones, that are needed to operate the system. Therefore the fulfilment of the following criteria is mandatory.

\subsubsection{iOS application}

Through the provided \emph{iOS} app the user needs to be able to authenticate himself against the back end server. As shown in section \vref{sec:SellingPoint} one of the main objective of this software is the unification of the communication channels. Therefore every registered user has to be able to use the app to review his personal event calendar, as well as sending and receiving messages. By providing this information without the need of any interaction from the user, these functionalities provide a maximum amount of usability for every persona presented in \vref{sec:UserAnalysis}. 

By using the auto layout capability of the \emph{iOS} development suite, an application's layout is automatically adjusted to the screen size and ratio of the user's device. Nevertheless an \emph{iPad} has obviously a bigger screen than an \emph{iPhone} or \emph{iPod touch} and therefore a layout optimised for a smaller device might be less user friendly on a tablet. Since the information provided by the system are going to be checked at home as often as on-the-go, a phone app is more applicable than a tablet app. Therefore it is an obligatory requirement to optimise this application for the operation with the latest \emph{iOS} device generation, more specifically the \emph{iPhone 6}.

To be able to ensure the usage of the latest features provided by the \emph{iOS} \gls{SDK} throughout the next couple of years, the application needs to be developed using the recently released programming language \gls{SWIFT}.

\subsubsection{Web application}

An administrator obviously needs to be able to provide the information requested by the member's app through the web application. This includes the possibility to schedule an event, and create user. The administrator needs to populate each user's profile with information provided by the user. On top of that the user needs to be able to modify the basic behaviour of the system as flexible as possible.

Since the system is storing private user data is is necessary to secure the application and pursue the \gls{LeastPrivileges} principle. Therefore the log in should only be allowed for user that are at least second level administrators and these user should only be able to view users directly managed by them.

As shown in section \vref{sec:UserAnalysis}, the administrator has only basic skills in using technology. Concluding the the above discussed functionalities need to be as straight forward as possible. It is especially difficult when trying to combine usability and flexibility. The implementation of this trade off has to be considered closely.

\subsubsection{Back-end}

Since the application needs to be accessed from different devices, only a 2- or 3-tier architecture is applicable for this system. After reviewing the findings in section \vref{sec:Architecture} the decision was made to use a 3-tier architecture, based on the possibility of a more sophisticated security policy and an advanced business logic. The design should also keep scalability in mind, to ensure the flexibility to manage growing clubs.

To run the back-end application on a variety of operating systems the cross platform programming language \emph{Java} has been chosen. To take advantage of the latest features of \emph{Java} the 2014 released version 8 is going to be used within this project. To simplify the development of a web application with \emph{Java} the open-source \emph{Java Spring} framework was chosen. It is providing straight forward techniques to create a web server, which is incorporating sophisticated security features and the access of a durable data provider, which is also needed within this project.

\subsection{Optional requirements} % nice-to-have
The requirements presented in this section are not implicitly necessary for the system to work, nevertheless the overall usability of the system would be highly reduced, when these functionalities would not be part of the initial implementation.

To enhance the convenience of the application, the organisation of user into divisions should be introduced. The administrator needs to be able to assign divisions to the user's profile through the web application. This includes the need of being able to create and modify the division. As discussed in \vref{sec:Functionality} the arrangement of the divisions needs to be as flexible as possible. This would enable the focus of received messages on certain topics, by automatically creating groups, according to the divisions a user is part of. Following the same principle, the invitation to events could be filtered using the membership of users within divisions.

The web and \emph{iOS} applications should both have a user friendly and sophisticated user interface. This includes the need of a well designed navigation concept and a unified colour scheme. The details of the \gls{UI} design are presented in section \vref{sec:Wireframes}. 

The platform should also support the sharing of user taken photos with the club's administration. Therefore the \emph{iOS} application needs to offer the ability to shoot photos, or select previously taken ones and upload them to the server. Additionally the administrator needs to be able to review the uploaded pictures and download them, so he can use them for any club related activity.

\subsection{Additional requirements}
\label{sec:AdditionalReq}

The following features are not required and their implementation is probably exceeding the time frame provided by this project. Nevertheless their definition is given here since they would increase the usability significantly. 

The system could support the news feed feature addressed in section \vref{sec:Functionality}. On the one side, this would require the web application to enable the administrators to publish news and relate them to existing divisions. On the other side the \emph{iOS} application needs to be able to display a user specific news feed, presenting all relevant information. On top of that the backend could provide a \gls{RSS} feed, an automated email newsletter containing summaries of the published news, or extensions for blog hosting webpages, like \emph{Joomla} or \emph{Wordpress}. This would improve the integration of user, that do not own a supported smartphone, or do not want to directly participate with the system.

The \emph{iOS} application could gain additional functionalities, including the possibility to access multiple \emph{myVerein} instances from a single device. This is due to the fact that people engaged in a club, might also engage in other clubs. If both of them are running an instance of \emph{myVerein} it would be very inconvenient for the user to constantly change between the accounts within the application. Additionally the application could be optimised for the operation on an \emph{iPad}, which would improve the usability, when using the application at home on this device.

\subsection{Non-requirements} %need-not-to-have

It is important to delimit the functionalities of a system and therefore define ones that are NOT part of the development of a software. The following features fall into this category of non-requirements.

The \emph{myVerein} system should not replace a club homepage. Therefore it should not provide any non-member facing functionalities or information. This means that the system is not replacing software packages like \emph{Joomla} or \emph{Wordpress}. Nevertheless as outlined in section \vref{sec:AdditionalReq}, it might be possible to integrate \emph{myVerein} into these systems.

Finally the \emph{iOS} application is not designed to operate stand-alone, as a private club managing application. Therefore a user who wants to use the app needs to be part of a club, which installed, configured and uses the \emph{myVerein} environment.

\section{Architectural model}
\label{sec:ArchitecturalModel}
After evaluating the findings from section \vref{sec:Architecture}, in section \vref{sec:ObligatoryReq} the decision was made to use a 3-tier architecture, keeping scalability in mind. Figure \vref{fig:Architecture} shows the planned architecture of the system. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{./images/architecture.png}
  	\caption{System architecture, own figure}
	\label{fig:Architecture}
\end{figure}

The central server software is written in \emph{Java 8} and uses the \emph{Java Spring} framework. This mature open source framework provides sophisticate security configurations as well as several access frameworks for data provider. On top of this platform several other additional frameworks are available, including messaging and social media connection, that can be used to easily extent the functionalities of the application. The complete business logic is implemented on top of this framework.

Since the server application needs to be run within the \gls{JVM} and be able to communicate with other machines, an application server is necessary. For this test environment a \emph{Tomcat 8} application server was chosen to host the application. For the possibility to easily and efficient server static content, the application server is connected to an Apache web server using the \gls{AJP}. 

The data provider was chosen to be a \emph{MongoDB} \gls{NoSQL} database system. This schema free database enables flexibility, as well as extensibility and speed, which is not comparable to existing relational database applications \cite{Moschetti:2014aa}. The database itself is connected with the server application using the \emph{Spring Data} framework, which supports the use of \emph{MongoDB}. This framework provides a concise and object oriented access to the database using the native \emph{Java} driver developed by \emph{MongoDB}. Most importantly it integrates very well into the \emph{Java Spring} framework.

To ensure high flexibility the system is designed to operate behind a load balancer. Therefore each system needs to be stateless and retrieve all necessary information and configuration from the central data provider. If this is the case, the necessary computing power to fulfil all requests can be automatically allocated and deallocated, by deploying additional \emph{myVerein Server Instances}, or removing them. This would allow a cost efficient, high available, large scale operation within a cloud environment.  

The front end of the system consists of an iOS app and a web application. Both of them use a \gls{REST} \gls{API} to communicate with the system. The \gls{API} is designed to be used by many different application and should therefore simplify the process of adding new front-end components to the system. By using this model, the development of these components can be done independently from the development of the server as long as the existing \gls{API} is not changed.

The web application is intended to be used by the administrator only to manage the system. Within this web application only the features that are relevant for the administrator need to be accessible. This application should avoid the reloading of the current page by using the principles of \gls{AJAX}. On top of that the application should be designed to be as mobile friendly as possible, to enable administrators to use it on their mobile devices as well. To create a rich \gls{UI} and feature set, while keeping the workload on the developer as small as possible, several \gls{CSS} and \gls{JS} frameworks are going to be used.

The iOS application's target group are the member's of the clubs using this system. The application is going to be developed using \emph{Apple}'s new programming language \gls{SWIFT}. Additionally the dependency manager \emph{CocoaPods} is going to be used for adding existing frameworks to the project. This is done to simplify the development of the application, while increasing the usability.

\section{Database layout}
\label{sec:DatabaseLayout}

As presented in section \vref{sec:ArchitecturalModel} the data provider used for this project is going to be the \gls{NoSQL} database system \emph{MongoDB}. Even though this system uses a dynamic schema, it is important to model the organisation of the data in advance, to later ensure a reliant and consistent operation. Nevertheless this schema is very likely going to change during development, but the dynamic aspect is very helpful within the context of this agile development approach.

A database schema can be depicted using an \gls{ER} diagram. This visual representation of a database layout was originally introduced for relational databases, nevertheless it was adopted for this work into the context of \gls{NoSQL} databases. The diagram created during the design phase and used as orientation during the development can be found in appendix \vref{app:ERDesignPhase}. It is important to note, that during the design of the database schema all requirements discussed in \vref{sec:Requirements} have been considered.

Within this sections each entity, in the context of a document oriented database like \emph{MongoDB} better known as document store, is going to be described in details. The connection between documents is also discussed.

\subsection{User}
The user information are stored within the \emph{User} document store. The data is organised according to the \emph{One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents} model \cite[p. 141]{Mongo:2014aa}.

On the lowest level all required information about the user, like the user's email or his hashed password, are stored. The private information of a user, which can only be viewed by the administrator are saved within the \emph{PrivateInformation} array. The \emph{PublicInformation} array is holding all optional information stated by the user. These information can be accessed by every member of the club.

On top of that each user is part of one ore more divisions. The membership within the divisions is stored as nested arrays. These data structures hold the foreign key to the division as well as the date when the user joined the division.

\subsection{Division}
Each division is an entry within the division's document store. It is defined by its name and short description.

Divisions are organised hierarchical within a club, so this structure has to be represented within the database. This data structure is going to be represented within MongoDB using the \emph{Model Tree Structures with an Array of Ancestors} \cite[p. 149]{Mongo:2014aa}. This structure is storing the direct parent of the node, as well as an array of all ancestors, to easily query all ancestors. Within the use case of this application this behaviour is needed, since the system needs to subscribe the user to all chats of the user's division as well as all chats above his division.

Each division is administrated by up to one user, who gains access to the administrator panel through this position. If there is no administrator specified, the super admin takes his role. This super user is defined by being administrator of the root division.

\subsection{Messages}
Each member of a division automatically joins a group chat between all members of this division. To ensure privacy for each chat, messages are only saved on the server as long as necessary. Therefore a \emph{Message stack} document store is created. Every sent message is stored there until the recipient accesses it, or the system deletes the message after its expiration. The expiration of the message is handled by MongoDB through the functionality to set a Time-To-Life for collections \cite[p. 198]{Mongo:2014aa}.

Each entry contains the message to one member of the group chat. When the user syncs his application with the server, the server returns all messages from the stack for the user. The rows are deleted as soon as the user receives the message. 

\subsection{Events}
A core feature of the application is the creation and management of events for each division. The events are managed within the \emph{Event} data store. An event invites whole divisions, and every member can send a response to the invitation. 

The invited divisions are stored as embedded documents according to the \emph{One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents} model \cite[p. 141]{Mongo:2014aa}, because it is unlikely that the user is going to add values to that field. If the amount of data added to these fields extends the reserved space for the document, the database has to reallocate the space, which leads to fragmentation and a slow write performance. Concluding the responses of the users is stored according to the \emph{One-to-Many Relationships with Document References} model \cite[p. 143]{Mongo:2014aa}, since these fields are constantly extended.

The database is trying to keep the used storage low and therefore tries to delete all events that have already passed. Besides that the event has several properties, e.g. a short description, a location, the date of the event and its last change.

\subsection{Pictures}
Since the user is able to upload pictures that are relevant to the club, a document store is created to manage these pictures. The picture's metadata is handled through that store, as well as the URL pointing to the file and an array with tags for the picture.

Each picture is uploaded by a specific user and the user can associate up to one division to the picture.

\section{Wireframes and Mockups}
\label{sec:Wireframes}

During the design phase wireframes have been created to get an initial sense of how the application is going to look like. The findings from section \vref{sec:UIConceptWeb} and \vref{sec:UIConceptiOS} have been included into this early \gls{UI} design. The wireframes were designed, trying to meet all requirements from section \vref{sec:Requirements}.

\subsection{Web application}

The wireframes for the web application can be found in appendix \vref{app:WebWireframe}. The top of the page is representing the navigation area. A conservative navigation approach was chosen, because of the limited amount of time for this project as well as the small amount of negative aspects of this concept. A total of six elements is placed in the top bar which is more than the optimum of five elements but not quite the suggested maximum amount of seven items.

The first frame is showing the log in screen. The placeholder on top of the login fields could either hold the default logo, or a custom logo provided by the club's administrator. Every user is going to be able to access this page and enter his credentials. All upcoming pages can only be accessed if the user is an administrator.

The second page is showing the dashboard of the application. This page gives statistics about the system and its users and might also inform the administrator about upcoming birthdays or anniversaries. From this page the administrator is also able to publish news, that later can be received by the user.

The next pages shows the user management page, where the administrator is able to view, alter, create and delete users. The left hand side lists all registered users and the right hand side presents all available information about the currently selected user. Within this form the administrator is able to subscribe the user to every available division. The user list on the left can be filtered using the search field on top of the list.

The fourth page is the division management page, which shows the arrangement of all created divisions on the left in a division tree. The tree can be altered in every possible way, as long as a tree-like structure is maintained. Every division can consequentially have an unlimited amount of subdivisions. The administrator is able to rearrange the divisions to fit his needs. On top of that he can view and alter the divisions on the right side after selecting the appropriate one. 

The events management page is the fifth page presented in this section. On the left hand side a calendar is presented and after selecting a date all events that are scheduled for the selected date are presented underneath the calendar. When selecting one of the events, its details are loaded into the right hand form, where they can be modified. Within this form the invited divisions are listed and can be added or removed.

The next page shows the picture management page, that shows all uploaded images by the user. The pictures are filtered according to the division they were uploaded through. The user can filter the picture using the division tree on the left side.

The last wireframe is the settings page, where the admin can adjust settings for the system. Only the super admin can alter information on this page. The system enables the user to upload a custom club logo on this page and change information like the club name. Second level administrator can only change their password on this page. 

\subsection{iOS application}
The mockups for the iOS application can be found in appendix \vref{app:iOSWireframe}. The mockup is displayed using a storyboard presentation, showing the connection between each view.

For the initial implementation of the application the decision was made to use the conventional navigation concept of a tab bar located at the bottom of the window. This is mainly due to the fact that the implementation of an alternative navigation concept is very time consuming and would need additional user testing to ensure its usefulness.

Starting at the bottom of the mockup page, the screen shown there is the event management tab. This view shows a calendar in the upper half of the screen and the list of events, scheduled for the currently selected date, in the lower half of the screen. Only events are shown, where the user has been invited to. Additionally another screen could be implemented showing more details of a specific event.

Continuing clockwise, the news feed is the next screen. Within this view each posted news, that is applicable for the user is shown. The user is able to scroll through the posts and thereby inform himself about the club.

The next screen is the messages screen, which is showing all currently subscribed divisions, which have an enabled chat functionality. Within the mockup the conservative table view approach is shown, but the implementation of the alternative overview discussed in section \vref{sec:ChatOverview} is still considered. From this screen the user is able to access the chat screen. This screen is based on the design of the stock \emph{iMessage} app.

The upper right screen is the photos section, where the user is able to shoot pictures within the app. After taking the picture he is able tag it with a division he is part of and upload it to the \emph{myVerein} server. The user is also able to choose an already taken picture from his camera roll.

The last screen, which is not described yet, is the settings tab. In this view, the user is able to change his personal profile and change general settings that apply for his local device. This might include preferences about event reminder, in app notifications and other behaviours.

\section{Licensing}

When creating any kind of intellectual property, that is supposed to be published, it is always necessary to think about the licensing of the work. Today an author or developer has the possibility to choose from a variety of available licenses, each with different purpose or restrictions. The main question on this topic is around the fact if the work should be part of the public domain, and therefore enable other people to use and share it freely, or not. 

It is a personal attitude to enable other people to learn and benefit from my work, if the circumstances allow it. Therefore I decided to license the documentation work done within this project using a \gls{CCLicense}. This enables user to retrieve, distribute and alter the work free of charge, as long as it is not used within a commercial environment, the appropriate attributes have been given and the altered work is published under the same license. \cite{Commons:2015aa}

The code written within this project is licensed using a \gls{GNUGPL}. This allows every person free of charge to use, modify and distribute the work, even in a commercial application, as long as the original source is included, the changed sections have been marked and the author received the appropriate attributions. On top of that every work that uses this system needs to be licensed using a license that is compatible with the \gls{GNUGPL}. Last but not least, a disclaimer is included, excluding the developer from his liability for damage caused by the software. \cite{Foundation:1991aa}

In general releasing a software under an open-source license has three major benefits: First, the software itself can be reviewed for security or logical errors and every user can contribute fixing bugs or adding new content to the application. Additionally user trust open-sourced software more than proprietary ones, because of the possibility of these audits. This is a benefit when handling private data. Second, since the usage of the application is free, the adoption rate of the software could be higher compared to a non-open-sourced application. Last but not least the software can help other people to educate themselves and therefore support software developers to learn from the experience gained through this work.

\chapter{Implementation}
\label{chapter:Implementation}
Within this chapter the final implementation is presented. All findings of the previous chapters build up to the execution described here. Because of technical difficulties and a limited amount of time, certain things discussed in \vref{chapter:Design} had to be discarded or changed. Nevertheless most of the requirements could be realised. It is important to note that the time did not permit an extensive testing phase, therefore this software should be considered as an early beta product. There are several known issues at the time of this writeup, which can be found within \emph{Github}'s bug-tracker located at \url{https://www.github.com/steilerDev/myVerein/issues}.

\section{Visual branding}
As discussed in section \vref{sec:BrandingConcept} the branding and therefore recognisability of a brand is one of the most important part of creating a new system, that needs to be placed on the market. 

\subsection{Color scheme}
After considering the findings in section \vref{sec:ColourConcept} the author decided to use a \emph{Tetradic} colour scheme. The base colour should be the most dominant one, where the other three ones should be used to draw the user's attention. 


MORE COLOR THEORY!

After considering different colour tones as base colour, the decision was made to go for a soft green colour, more specificly the one defined through the hex code \texttt{0x13CD78}. It was chosen, because of it's calming property, which qualifies it for a base colour and based on the fact that the author liked the tone very much.

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{./images/architecture.png}
  	\caption{Colour scheme created using \cite{Paletton:2015aa}}
	\label{fig:ColourScheme}
\end{figure}

Figure \vref{fig:ColourScheme} shows the applied \emph{Tetradic} method on the above mentioned base colour. The three other colours, which fit very well to each other, are very suitable to draw attention in a green/white dominated environment, that is going to be created within the \emph{web} and \emph{iOS} app. The blue colours are going to be used for general information, where the orange tones are used for warning and the red ones for errors.

\subsection{Logo}
Using the colour scheme presented in the previous chapter, a logo, used among others as app icon, is going to be presented within this section. The concept shown in section \vref{sec:Icon} was selected and advanced. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{./images/logo-final.png}
  	\caption{Final logo and app icon, own figure}
	\label{fig:Logo}
\end{figure}

Figure \vref{fig:Logo} is showing the final logo, which is similar to early concept shown in figure \vref{fig:AppSketch}. The only main difference is the adoption of the system wide colour scheme. The logo itself is therefore kept very simple and flat, while adding a 3D effect through the banner, making it more interesting. The dominant colour of the logo is the base colour of the brand's colour scheme, which is used to create a strong connection with the application itself.

\begin{figure}[h]
  	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{./images/icon-context.png}
  	\caption{App icon within context and \emph{iOS} guideline grind, created using \emph{Pixel Resort}'s template}
	\label{fig:IconFinal}
\end{figure}

Finally the simplicity and lack of writing allows the logo to scale perfectly. Actually the logo was created using a vector program, allowing it to scale in any possible way. Figure \vref{fig:IconFinal} shows the final icon rendered using the different resolutions and context it is going to appear within the \gls{OS}. Important to note is, that the icon itself is backgrounded by a gradient going from the green base colour on the upper left to the blue alternative colour of the scheme in the bottom right.

\section{Back-end}
The architecture of the system presented in section \vref{sec:ArchitecturalModel} did not change during the implementation. Therefore the back-end was created using the Java programming language and with the aspect of scalability in mind. The development of the server is presented in this section, highlighting the most important parts of the system, but not going into every detail.

\subsection{Frameworks}
\label{sec:FrameworksServer}

In todays world a lot of open-source frameworks are available to simplify the creation of complex systems, by providing fundamental functionalities. To efficiently manage the growing amount of dependencies within such a project, a dependency management framework is highly recommended. By using the state-of-the-art \emph{Maven 3} framework managing third party libraries and their versions is highly simplified. Especially when working within a team, this management system is ensuring, the usage of the same library versions across the team, without the need of pushing them into the version controlling system. It also helps to keep track of the currently used version and might help migrating to never revisions. To simplify this project several well tested frameworks have been used.

The most dominant framework used is called \emph{Spring}. This suite of frameworks is aiming on simplifying \emph{Java} and \emph{Java EE} application. Three main branches of \emph{Spring} have been used: The first one is the \emph{Spring WebMVC} framework, enabling the fast development of \gls{MVC} conform web applications. The second one is the \emph{Spring Data MongoDB} framework, allowing an easy and object oriented access of the database. For more information see section \vref{sec:ImplementationDB}. Finally the \emph{Spring Security} framework is the last \emph{Spring} framework used within the project, providing a concise interface for securing the platform. A detailed presentation on the used policies is shown in section \vref{sec:ImplementationSec}.

Another very important aspect during development is logging. The logging overhead should be as small as possible, to reduce a performance impact on the application. Nevertheless a sufficient amount of log messages need to be written, to simplify the process of backtracking bugs and security breaches. To combine these two requirements a professional logging framework is necessary. One of the most important logging frameworks within the \emph{Java} programming language is \emph{Log4j2}. It provides an easy interface, is highly customisable and delivers a high performance. Additionally the \emph{SLF4J} bridging framework was used, enabling the inclusion of logging messages from 3\textsuperscript{rd} party libraries like \emph{Spring}.

The configuration of the logging framework is possible by manipulating the \texttt{log4j2.xml}, located within the class path. A manually added \texttt{log4j2.xml} always overwrites the default one provided by application. The configuration file for this project can be found in appendix \vref{app:log4jConf}. It has a third party log level of \enquote{Info} and a log level of the \emph{myVerein} application of \enquote{Trace}. The log is written to the \texttt{stdout} (in general this is the console) and into a rolling file called \texttt{myVerein.log}, located within the default tomcat log directory. This log file can be analysed to find vulnerabilities of the application.

\subsection{Scalability}

As shown in section \vref{sec:ArchitecturalModel}, one instance of the \emph{myVerein} system should be able to run on multiple servers at the same time. The load should be distributed on the servers using a load balancer. By enforcing this architecture the platform is able to dynamically scale, depending on the workload on the system.

This kind of architecture is only possible if each instance of the server is stateless and retrieves all variable settings from a central data repository. By using this technique any settings change made to one system is instantly adopted by instances. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = "Example layout of settings document", label=lst:SettingsDoc]
{
	"clubName" : "myVerein", 
	"initialSetup" : false, 
	"customUserFields" : [
		"Membership Number",
		"Nickname"
	],
	"rootDivision" : DBRef("division", ObjectId("553f92eb45661c558b00c0e9")) 
}
\end{lstlisting}

This behaviour is realised by storing all settings within a dedicated document store on the MongoDB data provider. Listing \vref{lst:SettingsDoc} shows an example document within the settings document store. The available settings are currently very limited and only provide the possibility to set a club name, define the root division and add custom fields to every user profile. It is important to note that there is only one document allowed within the document store, since the systems cannot know which of the documents to choose. As soon as an instance encounters more than one document, every document but the first retrieved one is removed and a warning is issued. 

Of course a stand alone instance cannot know how to access the database. One way to solve this problem would be to hard code the information about the data provider within the source code, but that would lead to a low customisability. Therefore every instance has a local \texttt{myVerein.properties} file within their resources folder, which is loaded during start up. This files holds the information about the hostname, port, username, password and database name of the \emph{MongoDB}. The remaining \texttt{developmentMode} property is only important for debugging purposes and decides if the server should server the minified versions of the \emph{JavaScript} files or the larger, non-minified ones. Concluding the only thing that needs to be modified when adding a new instance to a cluster is this properties file.

An initial setup is only possible, if there is no document within the settings document store of the database, specified by the above mentioned properties file, or if this document's \texttt{initialSetup} flag is set to true. If either of the previous properties holds true, the access of the index page will present a page, leading through the initial setup. When specifying all required information, the provided database is going to get dropped and the system needs to be restarted manually. This method is used when trying to reset the system through the settings page of the administration panel. 

\subsection{Database}
\label{sec:ImplementationDB}

In the first part of this section the final layout of the database is presented, and the second part is showing the object-oriented mapping provided by the \emph{Spring Data} framework. The decision made in section \vref{sec:ArchitecturalModel} did not change during the implementation and therefore the data-provider is the \gls{NoSQL} database \emph{MongoDB}.

\subsubsection{Final layout}

In section \vref{sec:DatabaseLayout} the initial layout of the data provider was presented and explained. Even though the planning was well-conceived, some functionalities had to be changed, because of unforeseen technical difficulties or changes within the feature set. The final \gls{ER} diagram can be found in appendix \vref{app:ERFinal}. The differences between the final layout and the one presented in section \vref{sec:DatabaseLayout} are going to be discussed in this section.
