\chapter{Introduction}

Especially in rural areas, today's world of clubs is dominated by small and medium size organizations. Based on my experience, these clubs are mostly managed using outdated techniques and their communication channels are mostly handled through existing social networks, electronic or non-electronic mail. This is due to the fact that most of the members and management boards of the societies are either not familiar enough with the complexity of the few modern club management solutions, do not know of their existence or can't see the implications of using them.

\emph{myVerein} is trying to solve these problems and provide a comprehensive and intuitive solutions for small and medium size clubs. This solution should use the benefits of the recent developments of the IT industry and the principles of cloud and mobility solutions to create the club management solution of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century. 

In the following chapters the process of planning and designing as well as the execution is going to be discussed. 

\section{Market analysis}
A common principle in todays business is analysing all comparable products and solutions, that are used by potential customers. These solutions might not even be designed for that purpose, but could be misused by the user, because they fit their need.

The most important part of this step is to find the mistakes your competitors made and learn from their behaviour \cite{Hunter:2015aa}. From these findings, it is possible and important to draw parallels and use them to \enquote{model what is working for your competition and [...] not copy your competition directly} \cite{Hunter:2015aa}. 

There exists several ways of identifying and monitoring competitors. When talking to potential customer, it is possible to get a closer look at their current solution to the proposed problem \cite{Philips:2015aa}. Another possible way is to use web searches to try and find solution targeted at your problem. With the help of a search engine it is also possible to get a first look on the presentation and marketing concepts of the identified rivals \cite{Philips:2015aa}. Of course there are additional steps available, including gathering information within social media platforms, at trade conferences or email newsletter \cite{Dahl:2011aa}. 

Within this section these competing services that have been identified and analysed in preparation for this work are going to be presented. The following concept and implementation is based on these findings.
