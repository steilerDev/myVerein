\begin{abstract}

Within this student research paper a server client environment should be developed, which can be used to manage the members of a club and simplify and unify the communication between the board as well as between the users themselves. The need for this kind of application is based on the experience that a lot of -- especially small -- clubs are still paper based and the availability of comprehensive solutions is very limited.

After a careful consideration of the market demand it showed to me that a centralised open-source solution would be a perfect fit. This enables skilled members of a club to self host the application reasonably priced, as well as providing several other benefits shown in this paper.

After a thoughtful analysis the application's first version has been created, containing basic management and communication capabilities. The server was developed using the Java programming language, bundled with the Spring framework, while the iOS application was written in Swift together with Apple provided frameworks as well as third party extensions. The work respects several paradigms that should support the further development and extensibility of the environment. Nevertheless the version relevant for this paper includes all basic requirements and is fully functional, even though it is still in a beta phase, since the time did not permit an excessive user experience testing.
