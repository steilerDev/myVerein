<p>The system aims to leverage clubs and societies to the 21st century by offering them a simple, secure and unified way to manage the members of a club, share information and exchange thoughts between them.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-vision" class="anchor" href="#the-vision" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Vision</h2>

<p>The open source project intends to create an easy to use and intuitive server application that can be self hosted and administrated by the local IT administrator, as well as a mobile application used by the members of the society.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The application is offering the officers of the society the possibility to share relevant information about their club, like upcoming events or news, with their members. The shared information then can be accessed by every registered member through the mobile application. The system is intended to be able to notify the user about every relevant information. These information are filtered according to the membership of every user.</p></li>
<li><p>The members are able to chat with each others through automatically created chatrooms. The access to the chatrooms is managed according to the responsibility of every user within the club.</p></li>
<li><p>This project intends to provide a simple member management, offering several key functions. Currently the development is considering the possibility to remind the board about upcoming honours for members, because of the duration of their membership or the management of contact and payment details.</p></li>
<li><p>The project might include a way to publish news through a Joomla, Wordpress (or other CMS) plugin for the club's homepage and an autogenerated Mail Newsletter for every member, who does not have the possibility to use the mobile application, or even provide a way to print out the newsletter for each member that does not have access to a digital communication service.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By using a self hosting approach the information are only shared with registered users or trusted administrators, respecting the privacy of the society and its members.</p>
